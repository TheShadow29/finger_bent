# finger_bent
Image processing by matlab to check if the finger is bent

=======================
##Pre-requisites
**It has been made on Matlab 2013a, though no version-specific function has been used, can't guarentee it will with lower versions
Also, use it in windows, as some drivers for webcam used are specific for windows.

##How to use
*Simply open the file m10.m
*Clear everything
*Press F5
*One of the screen shows the original input, the other shows image with only the fingers shown.
*Your complete hand should be seen in the webcam, it should not go out of the range.
*The hand should be darker in comparison to the background, if possible keep a light source behind it
*An array of 1x5 is printed on the command window, which shows 0 if the finger is bent and 1 if finger is straight.
